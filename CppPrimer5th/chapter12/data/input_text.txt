// Exercise 12.27: The TextQuery and QueryResult classes use only
// capabilities that we have already covered. Without looking ahead, write your
// own versions of these classes.
int exercise12_27();

// Exercise 12.28: Write a program to implement text queries without defining
// classes to manage the data. Your program should take a file and interact
// with a user to query for words in that file. Use vector, map, and set
// containers to hold the data for the file and to generate the results for the
// queries.
