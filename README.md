# hello C++

In CppPrimerPlus folder, my solutions to <C++ primer plus 6th edition> 's programming exercises (including chapter 1 to chaper 18).

Above work has been done between 2022 Oct and 2023 Aug.

I'm doing <cpp primer 5th edition> 's programming exercises from 2023 Sep 17.

## Note:
Below dirs are downloaded from their official website, I'll only keep the source code that I modified.
Therefore, I add most of their sub-directory in .gitignore.
